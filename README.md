These are some of the projects that I have been working on for fun. They are probably not very organised but, as I said, it's all just for fun.


Tennis prediction: I found a csv containing a bunch of data from tennis matches going from 1968 to nowadays. I used that to calculate the Elo for each player, including the elo on each surface
which I used along with other parameters to construct a random forest that I used to predict who will win men's singles matches. I then created an HTML page to easily input the players. It averaged a
75% success rate when passing the whole database of data, and had a 72% success rate in the 2025 French Open before the tournament started.
